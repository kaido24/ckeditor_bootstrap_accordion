Drupal 8 CKEditor Plugins. WIP.

Install Process:

For now, each plugin is split into two directories: one module directory, which needs to be placed at /drupalroot/modules/, and a library directory which needs to be placed at /drupalroot/libraries (note, the libraries module at https://www.drupal.org/project/libraries must be installed). After both directories are placed, navigate to yoursite.com/admin/modules and activate the module in the GUI.

Todo:

Remove libraries dependency, roll everything into one module directory.
Bug fixes.
